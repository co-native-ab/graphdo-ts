// Drive scope abstraction for Microsoft Graph drive operations.
//
// `DriveScope` discriminates between the two ways graphdo can address a
// drive: `/me/drive` (the signed-in user's own OneDrive) and
// `/drives/{driveId}` (an explicit drive id, used today only by the
// generalised abstraction itself; production tools currently always
// construct `{ kind: "me" }`). Centralising the URL building here keeps
// every Graph helper free of hard-coded `/me/drive…` strings and makes the
// future cross-drive PR a localised change.

import type { ValidatedGraphId } from "./ids.js";

/**
 * Identifies the drive a Graph operation should target.
 *
 * - `{ kind: "me" }` resolves to `/me/drive…` and is the only variant
 *   constructed by current tools (we read it from the `"me"` sentinel
 *   stored in `workspace.driveId`).
 * - `{ kind: "drive"; driveId }` resolves to `/drives/{driveId}…` and is
 *   reserved for the future cross-drive PR (shared drives, SharePoint
 *   document libraries). The `driveId` must be a {@link ValidatedGraphId}
 *   so it cannot smuggle a path segment into the Graph URL.
